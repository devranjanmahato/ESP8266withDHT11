## ESP8266withDHT11 : DHT11 Humidity Temperature Monitor with NodeMCU on ThingSpeak
### It explains how to log Humidity & Temperature data on the cloud. We can use Thingspeak as a cloud service provider and DHT11 to measure temperature and humidity.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED :
###  1. NodeMCU ESP8266
###  2. DHT-11 Sensor
###  3. Connecting Wires

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT :
### This project is basically controlled by a microcontroller i.e NODEMCU ESP8266 and the sensor which is used in this project is DHT-11(Humidity and Temperature sensor). According to the environment sensor is responding and through WiFi connecting it will be display on a server that is ThingSpeak.
